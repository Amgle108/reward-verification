Note: The file `beta_airdrop.py` has been slightly modified to protect user privacy. 
As a result, its hash will not match the one stored on-chain. However, the logic, process, and outputs remain identical â€” the script will produce the same results using the same inputs, consistent with what was executed during the airdrop.
